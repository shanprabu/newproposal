            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>When does my Trip Credit get added and how do I redeem it?</h3>

            <p>If you are the Referee: The $150 Trip Credit is received by the “referee” (you) once the “referred” (your friend) has confirmed and paid the deposit towards their first trip with us and they have received a booking confirmation.  You can redeem any or all of your Trip Credit when you book your next trip with us.</p>

            <p>If you are the Referred: The $150 Trip Credit is deducted from your first booked trip with us.</p>


            <h3>How do I find out my Trip Credit balance?</h3>

            <p>Email Jen Marsden, <a href="#">jen@enchantingtravels.com</a>, your personal Guest Relations Manager at any time to receive your Trip Credit balance.</p>


            <h3>How do I find out which of my friends have booked a trip with you?</h3>

            <p>We will send you an email as soon as your referred friend has booked a trip with us!</p>


            <h3>Who is the Refer a Friend Program available to?</h3>

            <p>Anyone. All you need is your unique Refer a Friend URL to start referring your friends. If you do not have one, please contact Jen Marsden, <a href="#">jen@enchantingtravels.com</a>, your personal Guest Relations Manager.</p>


            <h3>Will my Trip Credit Expire?</h3>

            <p>Your Enchanting Travels Refer a Friend Trip Credit is valid for use if you book your trip before 31 December 2017 - even if your travel dates are after this date. All unused Trip Credits after this time will be void and your Trip Credit balance will return to $0. You will be informed via email if the program is extended.</p>


            <h3>Is there a limit to the amount of Trip Credit I can accrue?</h3>

            <p>There is no limit to the number of $150 Trip Credits you gain i.e. if 10 friends confirm their trip and travel with us, you will gain a credit balance of $1,500</p>


            <h3>What happens if my referral friend cancels their trip?</h3>

            <p>If the “referred” cancels their trip, the $150 Trip Credit will be subtracted back from your credit balance.</p>


            <h3>Any questions?</h3>

            <p>Please contact Jen Marsden, <a href="#">jen@enchantingtravels.com</a>, your personal Guest Relations Manager.</p>
