                    <p>Enchanting Travels exceeded my expectations. My husband and I have taken two trips to India using Enchanting - our first 'trip of a lifetime' quickly became a second trip. They have the best guides, take the time to really understand the trip you want and pay attention to every detail. Enchanting provides exceptional personal service by attentive staff, is good value for your money and is a company you can trust.</p>

                    <p>We just returned from India using Enchanting Travel as our tour company. They did an outstanding job this time navigating us through the busy streets of India. We were treated to magnificent forts and palaces, foods and handicrafts, and cultural experiences while our first rate guide and driver seamlessly and safely allowed us to experience amazing India. I highly recommend this company as I have had four inspiring trips using their expertise.</p>

The whole team from consultants to coordinators, from drivers to guides, they were exceptional! They really made my journey memorable, I really recommend Enchanting Travels to anyone and would surely travel with them again :)</p>

                    <p>From the planning stages through the trip itself we were delighted with Enchanting Travels! We felt they are a " detail" company. The guides were terrific and attended to us in lots of extra ways, the drivers and vehicles were special. We really enjoyed our accommodation, food and all the planned side trips. We didn't have any blips or snags in our 5 weeks.</p>

The trip was 100% tailor made for us. Our guides and drivers were top notch—very knowledgeable, unfailingly helpful, and accommodating to all our requests and needs. Likewise, the vehicles were new, clean, very comfortable, air-conditioned, and in perfect repair. Then, there was our excellent Travel Coordinator. She was available to us at all times throughout the trip.</p>

                    <p>My wife and I have nothing but raves about Enchanting Travels. I could, and will, “go on” about their services, but we have already made the most sincere endorsement we can make by booking our second excursion with them shortly after returning from our first. Both trips were to (magnificent) India, the first was to the north and the second was to the south. It’s important to us that they remain available 24/7, just in case things do not go off as planned, or if a change could make things even better.They delivered what was expected and much more, and that’s why we booked with them in 2015 and plan to do so again in the future.</p>
